% NOMINAL_LINE_GEOM: compute source and receiver positions for 2D synthetic
%
% [xshots,xrecs]=nominal_line_geom(x,nshots,offedge)
%
% Function distributes shots evenly along a 2D line while keeping them a
% reasonable distance from the edge. Receiver interval is taken as twice the
% model grid spacing so that the cmp spacing is equal to the model grid.
% Receivers span the model and the receiver spread is identical for all
% shots. The shot positions are chosen to be between adjacent receivers.
%
% x ... x coordinate vector for the numerical model. That is x(1) is the
%       beginning of the model, x(end) is the end, x(2)-x(1) is the numerical
%       grid spacing, and x(k+1)>x(k) for any k in [1 length(x)].
% nshots ... number of shots desired.
% spreadlength ... length of geophone spread (equivalent to maximum offset)
% ************* default = x(end)-x(1) **************
% offedge ... offset of first and last shot from the model edge
% ************** default: .05*(x(end)-x(1)) **********
%
% xshots ... vector of shot locations
% xrecs ... cell array of receiver locations (identical for all shots). The
%           length(xrec) will equal the length(xshots)
